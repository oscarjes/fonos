        <li>
          Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of Fonos per
          device for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is
          the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this

            <li>modify or copy the materials;</li>
            <li>
              use the materials for any commercial purpose, or for any public

            </li>
            <li>
              attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained in
              Fonos;
            </li>
            <li>
              remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the

            </li>
            <li>
              transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials
              on any other server.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these
          restrictions and may be terminated by Fonos Corporation at any time.
          Upon terminating your viewing of these materials or upon the
          termination of this license, you must destroy any downloaded materials
          in your possession whether in electronic or printed format.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>3. Disclaimer</h3>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>

          Corporation makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby
          disclaims and negates all other warranties including, without
          limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability,
          fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual
          property or other violation of rights.
        </li>
        <li>
          Further, Fonos Corporation does not warrant or make any
          representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or

      <h3>4. Limitations</h3>
      <p>
        In no event shall Fonos Corporation or its suppliers be liable for any
        damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or
        profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or
        inability to use Fonos, even if Fonos Corporation or a Fonos Corporation
        authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the
        possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow
        limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for
        consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to
        you.

        Corporation may make changes to the materials contained in Fonos at any
        time without notice. However Fonos Corporation does not make any
        commitment to update the materials.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fonos Corporation has not reviewed all of the sites linked to its app
        and is not responsible for the contents of any such linked site. The
